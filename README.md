## Abstract: 

The spread of Coronavirus started at the end of the year 2019 from the city of China, Wuhan. The continuous spread of the virus forced governments of various countries to put lockdown for several months. It has been observed that wearing a face mask can actually prevent the transmission of this deadly virus. In the future, we have to use a face mask as a preventive measure for any such viruses. However, manually it is very difficult to keep track of a person wearing a mask or not. And here technology plays a very crucial role. This project highlights the importance of deep learning especially object detection. We introduce a deep learning model that will detect faces and can predict whether the person is wearing a mask or not.
